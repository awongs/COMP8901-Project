# COMP8901 - Final Project
Built using Unity 2019.2.12f1 (64-bit)

## Game Rules
The game is a top-down shooter where the player must eliminate enemies while staying alive
for as long as possible. Enemies that die will respawn at a random location after a short delay.
For simplicity reasons, the game only has one level.

The player can:
* Move around with WASD keys
* Aim with the mouse
* Shoot with left mouse button

Shooting in the game is displayed by a red beam that starts from the shooter and ends at
whatever the beam collides with. This could be a wall, or it could be an opposing character.
There is no friendly fire in the game.

All enemies die in one shot, while the player can take up to six shots before dying. The current
health of the player is conveyed by a health bar displayed near the bottom left corner of the
game.
